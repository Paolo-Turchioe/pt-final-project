I chose this topic because I thought it would be interesting to look at the divergence between unemployment and laborforce participation.
Unemployment is close to historic lows, but laborforce participation has not recovered from the aftermath of the financial crisis.
There are some reasons to look at this spatially in that it allows for eyeballing where unemployment and participation diverge. It's especially interesting where you see entire regions diverge,  like in the Southeastern united states, which seems to have a low unemployment rate and a low laborforce participation. While this might be explainable in some states, like retirees in Florida, it would be interesting to research this further.

 The data relied on were extracted from the BLS, revised 2017 numbers.

 From a technical standpoint, I wanted to create a multi-layer map with mutually exclusive toggles.
